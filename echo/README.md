# Basic Echo Service

Step-by-Step procedure for creating a simple Process that will listen for and echo an HTTP Request payload.

## Purpose and Background

The objective of this exercise is to build a Process that will Listen for an HTTP POST with a payload, and reflect it back to the requestor. This is useful for the following reasons:

- To learn some of the very basics of the Boomi platform.
- To lay the foundation of a sandbox Process to inject and test different shapes.

## Process

- ***Step One***: [Build the Start Shape](doc/echoLab.md#build-the-start-shape)
- ***Step Two***: [Build the Web Services Server Listen Operation](echoLab.md)
- ***Step Three***: [Build the JSON Profile](echoLab.md)
- ***Step Four***: [Buildout the Process](echoLab.md)
- ***Step Five***: [Package and Deploy the Process](echoLab.md)
- ***Step Six***: [Configure the Webserver](echoLab.md)
- ***Step Seven***: [Test your Process](echoLab.md)
